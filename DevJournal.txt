Development Journal
2-6-15
	This week I created the git hub repository for Smart Door. I also created the Development Journal and am
creating the first entry. The read me for the repository was edited to describe what this project is about and what
it will do. I also did research into what it would take to send an email or notification to someone to alert them. 
I found out that java has an api that can be implemented called javax.mail and javax.mail.internet that adds in
methods that can be used to send emails. The email has to have a host server though to be sent from so I will need
to figure that out as well. I will most likely have the email be sent to the owner of the smart door so that they 
can get instant notification via email on their devices if a door or window is not in it's correct state.
