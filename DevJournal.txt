Development Journal

	This week I created the git hub repository for Smart Door. I also created the Development Journal and am
creating the first entry. The read me for the repository was edited to describe what this project is about and what
it will do. I also did research into what it would take to send an email or notification to someone to alert them. 
I found out that java has an api that can be implemented called javax.mail and javax.mail.internet that adds in
methods that can be used to send emails. The email has to have a host server though to be sent from so I will need
to figure that out as well. I will most likely have the email be sent to the owner of the smart door so that they 
can get instant notification via email on their devices if a door or window is not in it's correct state.

	This week I worked with Nate, my adult mentor, who is helping me learn how to interact with the hardware as
well as helping me acquire the necassary sensors and other hardware, to better understand what my goals are for this
project. He also showed my the program that I will be using to program the PLC that will be running my code. I will
be using Lenze's PLC Designer 3.8 software, using ladder logic with a codys based system. He also spent a few hours
with me teaching me the basics of PLC Designer so that I can get started working myself to create the code. We got
the code to recognize when a sensos was open or closed to keep track of the door's state, open and closed. One idea 
we were working on trying to figure out how to do was keep track of how many people are inside of a room, and if 
there is no one in the room to lock the door after a delay.

	This week I worked on designing an API to better understand what logic needs to go behind every function of my
design and what variables are going to be needed for every method. I was working on figuring out how to keep track of
people exiting and entering. I am going to use a sensor in front of the door to the room and also inside the room by
the door so that when someone walks in they trip one sensor and then the other sensor, and depending on the order they 
are tripped I will be able to tell if someone is entering or exitin a room and keep track of how many people are inside
of a room. I am still trying to figure out how to do this inside of PLC Designer and am trying to use rising edge and
falling edges of the sensors so that I can recognize which one is bein tripped when. I also got code that allows me to 
track the current state of the door, opened/closed and locked/unlocked.

	This week I worked with Nate to further develope the coding side of this project as well as getting a test system set up for me to be able to run my code. I got a plc with a single In and Out slice for sensors as well as a button that I can use to act as every sensor and input I will have in the future. I used this to help run and test my code and get it to actually work. We relized that I don't have the hardware easily available to keep track of people going in and out of a door so I decided that that aspect of this system will mostly likely have to not be done. I also got the code to recognize multiple alarms if they are already in the system that I can take an input off of and change the doors state depending on what is happening. Another feature that is being worked on is getting a command that puts the doors into an end of day state that locks all doors and sets alarms if one of those doors is oppened without the right authorization.

	This week I worked on developing code that allowed someone to access a door if need be after they have all been locked for the end of the day, and not set off an alarm. For this I am planning on having some sort of keypad with a code that allows the person to type in a code to unlock the door. My program will keep track that the door is unlocked due to that code being entered and when the code is input again the door will be locked back up. I am having some slight issues with this though due to having to use the same input to do both lock and unlock of the system. I am trying to work out a way to user a counter of some sort or delays in PLC designer to help enable this functionality of the program. I also finished up the first delevirable goal to recognize doors states.
